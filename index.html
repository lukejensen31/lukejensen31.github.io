        <p>
          Hi! My name is Luke Jensen, welcome to my portfolio!
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a current graduate student at the University of Colorado pursuing an M.S. Mechanical Engineering degree
          focusing on design and robotics. I have various industry experience, including work in facilities engineering,
          manufacturing, hands-on machine shop experience, and supporting live events as a stagehand.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy working in collaborative team environments and have been elected to multiple leadership positions in
          various organizations including the marching band at the University of Wyoming and the Theme Park Engineering
          and Design club at the University of Colorado. I am driven by my passion for learning new skills and applying
          them to both technical and personal projects.
        </p>  
        <p>
          Outside of my professional setting I enjoy mechanical work on my vehicle, 3D printing movie props, and spending
          time with family and friends.
        </p>
        <p class="fun-fact" title="Orange is my favorite color!">
          Fun Fact: Yes, the orange accents are intentional, it’s my favorite color.
