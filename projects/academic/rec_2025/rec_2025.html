        <p style="color:var(--muted);">
          The Ride Engineering Competition (REC) offers an opportunity for students to demonstrate real-world engineering practices within the ride engineering and design industry. The project lasted six months, which incorporated planning, design, and manufacturing a small attraction based on candy Starbursts as “riders.” The competition team was composed of members from the University of Colorado Theme Park Engineering and Design Club. The team was divided into three sub-teams: mechanical, electrical, and theming.
          <br>
          <br>The team decided on designing a double pendulum ride that had two vehicles that swing opposite directions of each other. This competition is hosted by The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. This put extra considerations on the design as it needed to be disassembled and packed into carry-on and checked luggage for travel.
