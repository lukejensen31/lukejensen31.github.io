            <p style="color:var(--muted);">
                During World War II, Willys-Overland Motors was awarded a contract with the
                U.S. Army to produce a light utility vehicle to mobilize military forces.
                As demand rapidly increased, Ford Motor Company was subcontracted to assist
                with production. By the end of the war, Willys and Ford produced approximately
                363,000 and 280,000 Jeeps respectively.
            </p>
            <p style="color:var(--muted);">
                In 1970, my father purchased a Ford GPW at the age of fourteen as his first
                vehicle. Over decades of use, including off-road driving and a rollover,
                the vehicle accumulated significant wear and tear. Eventually, the GPW
                was parked for 45 years when replacement parts were unavailable.
            </p>  
            <p style="color:var(--muted);"> 
                In May of 2020, my father and I began a full restoration of the vehicle.
                The project spanned four years and concluded with a fully functional,
                road ready 1943 Ford GPW.
